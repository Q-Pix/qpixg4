# Intended use:
# 
# source setup_marley.sh [opt. path to marley directory if not default from ReleaseBuilder]
#
# Only needs to be run before building the first time. Runs setup_marley.sh in marley repository, then sets CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and
# LIBRARY_PATH for building against Marley.
#
# NOTE: This uses the assumption that marley is built in the same directory as qpixg4, as ReleaseBuilder would do. If that is not
# the case, you will need to change

[ -z "$MARLEY" ] && source $1/setup_marley.sh
